### Hello, Ciao, Coucou!

This is **wang2**. 

I have over **8 years of experience** as a **Product Manager** in the **online advertising** and **e-commerce** industries,

and a few years as a **researcher in concrete and cement structures**, with an unfinished doctorate,

and so many years of experience in **coffee brewing**, **rock climbing**, and **marathon running**.

I’m currently building awesome projects powered by **90% artificial intelligence** and **10% authentic humanity**.

If you’re interested, feel free to leave a comment.
